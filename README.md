# Code-Versionierung-mit-GIT

This repository contains the Java files for a small Maven project that calculates the smallest value, the largest value, and the sum of all values from a small list.

It also teaches and practices the collaboration of two students through a versioning system.

It is the project of Stefanie Wieser and Bettina Ranzenbacher and solely created for exercise 1 (source code versioning with GIT).
